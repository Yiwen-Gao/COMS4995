## Description
Easy and intuitive code manipulation is necessary to understand and work with large codebases. Oftentimes, the basic copy and paste clipboard functions aren't sufficient for software development. This extension allows VSCode users to have access to multiclipboard functions.

## Usage
CMD+C (CTRL+C): copy the selected text
CMD+V (CTRL+V): paste the most recently copied text
CMD+; (CTRL+;): merge the selected text with the most recently copied text
CMD+' (CTRL+'): paste the most recently copied text and delete it from the clipboard
